This is the source code of the simulation program, which is used in a research article entitled "Incorporating thermodynamics in predator-prey games predicts the diel foraging patterns of poikilothermic predators". 

This program requires R (checked on R version 4.0.3), R package "Rcpp" and "BH". The Rcpp package requires C++ compiler (if your OS is Windows, please install Rtools from R official website). This program also requires "hmLib" version 4.4.1 (https://github.com/hmito/hmLib). Please download from the github website and state under the "TempSwimSpeedOptim" directory (so, ./TempSwimSpeedOptim/hmLib/[various files]). 

You can generate all figures shown on the article by running "Main.R".
